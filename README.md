# GeoSpace Data - ASMI

GeoSpace Data is a geospatial web application designed to provide users with a seamless way to interact with and analyze geospatial data. This project consists of both frontend and backend components, offering an easy-to-use interface for viewing, registering, and managing geospatial data.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely.
- **Geospatial Data Interaction**: Users can explore and interact with geospatial data on the web.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for different screen sizes and devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - ReactJS (with Next.js for server-side rendering)
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Axios for API requests

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js with Express for the REST API
  - MongoDB for database management
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication

## Prerequisites
